                He did penance. He pleased Brahma and Shiva. No matter how many obstacles he faced, he never wavered from his determination. He succeeded in taking Ganga to Pataland and became Manoratha. That is why the national slogan 'Bhagiratha effort' was formed in the matter of perseverance. Rama is a descendant of Bhagirath.
Vishwamitra's telling of the Gangavatharana to Rama has an implication. Knowing how great his ancestors were and living up to it. Showing how much devotion one should have towards parents. Telling how to persevere until the hard work is fruitful. But Vishwamitra did not say all this directly. But he understood the inner meaning. Rama This is the case with the best gurus.
Vishwamitra Ramalakshmanu reached near Mithilanagara. Rama saw an ashram there. It looks old and beautiful. But there is no crowd. Rama asked 'what film'. It was Gautama Maharshi's ashram, Vishwamitra explained the whole story, 'The great sage Gautama Maharshi used to stay in this ashram with his wife Ahalya. On one occasion, Gautama got angry thinking that Ahalya had committed a crime. He cursed her to remain in ashes in this ashram for thousands of years, consuming only food and drink and gas. They will not be seen by anyone. With the arrival of Rama, Vannadu is freed from the curse and attains his true form. 'Rama! Vishvamitra ordered that Ahalya be freed from the curse by stepping into Gautama's temple.
Ahalya in austerity, surrounded by ashes, is like the effulgence of a burning fire. Rama saw that Mahatmura. She was freed from the curse by the sight of Lord Rama. Ahalya Gautamulu respected Rama as usual. After receiving their favors, Rama accompanied Vishwamitra to the city of Mithila accompanied by Lakshmana.
<br><br>
Janakamaharaja, the lord of Mithilanagar, honored them appropriately. In Mithi, Ahalya Gautam's eldest son, Shatananda, had Ramadarshan. He thanked his mother for raising him. He praised Rama that it was a privilege to be able to obtain the grace of the great Vishwamitra. Sage Vishwamitra described the extraordinary powers. Satananda,
Next morning, Janaka Vishwamitra invited Ramalakshmana. He prayed to Vishvamitra to do the duty. Vishwamitra then replied 'These are the sons of Dasharatha Maharaja. World famous heroes. Want to see the Sagittarius near you. Show it. Good luck. He says that their love will be fulfilled. Then Janaka explained the history of 'Shivadhanus' which he had. He revealed his desire to make her a great warrior by saying that he found a baby while plowing the land for the sacrifice, and that she was named 'Sita' because she was found in the plow. Sita said that the one who can mount Shiva's bow is a suitable husband. He said that in the past, many kings had come and tried unsuccessfully to mount Shiva's bow, but no matter how much they said to mount it, they could not move it at all.
Hearing all this, Lord Vishwamitra asked him to bring Shiva's bow. Janaka said ok. Five thousand strong and long-lived men brought the casket containing Shiva's bow with great difficulty.
<br><br>
With the permission of Sage Vishwamitra, Rama held the middle part of the bow as Avali. As soon as the hand of Rama, who was trained in archery, was infected, the bow bent. He met Vintinari. Thousands of members were amazed. Rama pulled the string gracefully. The bow broke with a thunderous sound. All except Vishwamitra, Janaka and Ramalakshman fainted.
According to the given word, Janaka prepared to marry Sitaram. Dasharatha sent a present to Maharaja. Everyone came from Ayodhya. Janaka gave his daughters Sita and Urmila to Ramalakshmana and his younger brother Kusadhwaja's daughters Mandavi and Srutakirtula to Bharatasatrughna. Kalyans were held in grandeur,
The next day sage Vishwamitra blessed the new couple and Dasaratha went to the Himalayas to educate Janakamaharaja. Later Dasharatha left for Ayodhya along with Bandumitra.
On the way, Parasurama came in front of them. He is like Rudra of Pralayaka. He wore a gandragoddali and dhanurbhanas. Prajnaril was as fierce as fire. Kshatriyas are not enough for him. Formerly Kshatriya Kartaviryarjuna killed his father Jamadagni. From then on Kshatriya has put on a bracelet for extermination. He circumambulated the earth twenty-one times and sacrificed many Kshatriyas to his ax.
Parasurama challenged Sri Rama to bow his Vaishnava bow. Raghava said that it was okay. Defeated, Parasurama immediately left for Mount Mahendra.
Dasharatha reached Ayodhya with his entourage. Bharata went with Shatrughnu to his grandfather's house along with his uncle. Ramalakshman stayed in Ayodhya in the service of parents and teachers.
